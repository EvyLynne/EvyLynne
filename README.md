- 👋 Hi, I’m @EvyLynne
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Data Science ... My experience is Data Management / Database Developer and now as an Associate Software Engineer.  
- :memo: I also dabble in other computer related skills and techniques such as: 
- :clock1: embedded systems 
- :clock2: antique compiler  
- :clock3: HTML and front end work
- :clock4: C++ and other languages
- :alien: My unusual skills: I like working with people, working on teams, and documentation and diagrams. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Power BI at my job.  In my spare time I just built a new computer with the hubby and I'm working on the cross compiler for the MC6809 microprocesser 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on PBI, programming in almost any language, Machine Learning or anything else that happens to come along.  Reach out to me!

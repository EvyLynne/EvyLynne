- 👋 Hi, I’m @EvyLynne
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Data Science ... My experience is Data Management / Database Developer / Data Reporting.  My job title changes with each new company.  Now I'm an Associate Data Analyst.   
- :memo: I also dabble in other computer related skills and techniques such as: 
- :clock1: MS Fabric Certification 
- :clock2: antique compiler  
- :clock3: HTML and front end work
- :clock4: C++ and other languages
- :alien: My unusual skills: I like working with people, working on teams, and documentation and diagrams. I can knit two garments at the same time on the same set of needles (double knitting).
- 🌱 I'm currently very happy in my job and mostly continuing to maintain and build my network of colleagues. In my spare time I'm working on the cross compiler for the MC6809 microprocesser with my husband, a Principal Hardware Engineer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on PBI, programming in almost any language, Machine Learning or anything else that happens to come along.  Reach out to me!
